We are able to:

* Calculate the dividend yield and P/E ratio for a given stock (preferred or common) and current trade price.
* Record the trades in a market in terms of stock type, price, quantity and trade direction along with a timestamp.
* Calculate the volume weighted price of a given stock based on trades within a specific time frame of interest.
* Calculate the all share index of the market based on the geometric mean price of all stocks.
